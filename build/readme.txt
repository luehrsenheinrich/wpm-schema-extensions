== Description ==
The Schema.org markup can help search engines and other crawlers understand better what your site and content is about. The [Yoast SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) plugin does an amazing job of generating that markup.

But sometimes the markup generated by the Yoast plugin is not enough. There are some niche structures, that would not make sense to be implemented in a big plugin, as most of the users would not use those features. Any may be confused by their existence.

This is why this plugin exists. In this plugin we can add fun, useful and experimental Schema.org markup, that better describes what content is available on the site and what that content is about.

## Current Extensions

### Spouse
You can select another WordPress user in a user profile that is then marked as a [spouse](https://schema.org/spouse) of that user. Be advised, this connection is not bidirectional.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

I wrote this plugin, because I wanted to tell Google who my wife is. The 'spouse' markup was the first extension and with that came the thought, that other useful extensions might be available.

= Will this plugin work without Yoast SEO? =
No. This plugin builds on the amazing code developed by the Yoast Team and is a deliberate extension to their efforts.
